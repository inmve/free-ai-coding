# AI Coding Tools: Where Pro-Grade Models Are Actually Free 

Many AI coding tools claim to be "free," but access to pro-grade models usually runs out fast, then you're downgraded. Each tool uses different limits (credits, tokens, requests), making comparison difficult. This list puts them side by side to show what you actually get for free.

## TL;DR — Free Tiers for Pro‑Grade AI Coding
_(tools with higher limits listed first)_

| Tool | Pro‑grade models | Free tier limit | Credit card |

| [Warp](#warp) | GPT‑5, Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro | 150 requests/month | No |
| [Trae](#trae) | Claude 4 Sonnet (Beta), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro | 10 fast + 50 slow requests/month | No |
| [Amazon Q Developer](#amazon-q-developer) | Claude Sonnet 4 | 50 agentic requests/month | Yes |
| [GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot) | GPT‑4.1, Claude Opus 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Grok Code Fast 1 | 50 chat requests + 2,000 completions/month | No |
| [Windsurf](#windsurf) | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI | 25 credits/month | Yes |
| [Jules](#jules) | Gemini 2.5 Pro | 15 tasks/day | No |
| [AWS Kiro](#aws-kiro) | Claude 4 Sonnet, Claude 3.7 Sonnet | 50 credits/month | No |
| [Qoder](#qoder) | Qwen3-Coder-480B, Claude, GPT, Gemini | Limited credits (preview) | No (preview) |

## 5. Local Models

Running open-weight frontier models locally provides unlimited coding assistance without API costs or usage limits. Popular tools for local deployment include **[Cline](https://cline.bot/)** (VS Code extension with Plan/Act modes and MCP support), **[Aider](https://aider.chat/)** (command-line assistant with built-in Git integration), and **[Continue.dev](https://www.continue.dev/)** (open-source VS Code extension supporting 200+ models). All work seamlessly with **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** to run frontier models like Devstral (24B parameters, optimized for agentic coding), Qwen3-Coder, DeepSeek Coder V2, Codestral, and GLM-4.5.

**Note**: Frontier models require substantial RAM/VRAM. In particular, for Qwen3‑Coder‑480B the Ollama‑friendly GGUF is ~150GB, and practical local inference can require ~150GB of unified memory (RAM+VRAM), which makes it hard on typical laptops; the 30B quant commonly needs ~18GB. See the Unsloth Qwen3‑Coder local guide for details ([docs](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/qwen3-coder-how-to-run-locally)) and Simon Willison's article on [running GLM‑4.5 AIR on his laptop to build Space Invaders](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/29/space-invaders/) for a practical example.

---

## Comparison Notes

- **Goal**: Compare AI coding tools by their access to pro-grade models and free tier limits.
- **What qualifies a model as "pro-grade"?** Models must achieve ≥60% on SWE-bench Verified, demonstrating real-world software engineering capability. Current qualifying models: GPT-5 (74.9%), Claude Opus 4.1 (74.5%), Claude Sonnet 4 (72.7%), GPT-5 mini (71.0%), Qwen3-Coder-480B (69.6%), and Gemini 2.5 Pro (63.2%).
- **Different limit types**: Tools use various quota systems - requests, tokens, credits, chats - making direct comparison challenging. Check documentation for specifics.
- **Real-world usage**: Actual consumption varies dramatically based on coding style, task complexity, and tool implementation.
